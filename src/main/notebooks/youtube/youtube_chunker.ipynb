       "[\"great so we all know how important it is to be able to ensure the quality of your data and so that you can feel confident that there are as few bugs as possible so we've been improving how Cipher interacts with its types and that's what we're presenting here today now at a Storage level we've always had types I mean it's an part of a database to be able to store strings integers dates and so on however up until recently it has not been possible to use pure Cipher to interact with those types so you haven't been able to query if a data value is of a certain type or enforce those types using constraints now in Cipher we have around 16 different types as you can see here on this slide there's quite a few but there's also the super type of of any the sub type of nothing as well as Dynamic Union types we've also added a whole range of different synonyms to make it easier when you're writing your Cipher queries so I'm going to go through a couple of our more special types so firstly we have empty lists an empty list can be defined as a list of nothing and this will remain so until you add at least one item to the list so if I were to add like the value Boolean for instance we' now have a list of Boolean not null another special type to note would be the property value type so a property value type includes all of those types that are storable in the database so that includes strings integers floats Etc what this doesn't include is values like Maps uh nodes relationships because you can't actually store those as a node or relationship property uh so this one's actually quite useful if you want to check whether or not the value your have in your query is going to be the storable later on and one final note uh of a special type is a closed Dynamic Union type so this is more a combination of types so if you don't care whether or not your number is an integer or a float or perhaps if it's a list of integer and floats then you combine all these together and what use would all of these new types be without being able to use them so in 5.9 earlier in the year we added some new constraints so we now have no property type constraints and Rel relationship property type constraints so for example this allows me to now enforce that my movie title is of type string so that means I won't have any bad data where my movie title is perhaps an integer um and then these are part of Enterprise Edition only and alongside these we've also introduced typ predicate Expressions so these are\",\n",
       " \" Rel relationship property type constraints so for example this allows me to now enforce that my movie title is of type string so that means I won't have any bad data where my movie title is perhaps an integer um and then these are part of Enterprise Edition only and alongside these we've also introduced typ predicate Expressions so these are a handy way of testing whether or not your expression is of a certain type now an important thing to note here is that all Cipher types actually include the null value so this can be a little confusing but if I were to say is null of type Boolean I would actually receive true uh this might not be wanted actually so you can say null is of type Boolean not null and then you'll actually get false back we have finally added very recently as of the 5113 release earlier this week the value type function so this is a neat little function which will return a string representation of the mo most precise value type that the given expression evaluates to so in this example I want to know what the value type of the number one is and you'll get the string back integer not null this works similar to how in other programming languages have a type of maybe keyword or function but in neop and Cipher it's called value type and finally we've also been working hard on unifying our documentation and changing how the signatures and our show functions and show procedures commands work so as you can see here we now have the new types shown in the signatures and even closed dynamic types as you can see node or relationship or map for the properties function and we believe this makes it more usable and easier to read now to shine some light on how we use these new features I'll now pass you over to Louise so uh first we will look at uh our data set for the example uh so we have created a small toy data set uh which uh consists of our cyppher surface team at neop freier where me and yam are working uh so this data set contains notes for each person H me Y and our colleagues as well as notes for our two team dogs uh we uh each person has uh two properties a name and is node presenter while the dogs only have the name property and as you might can see even if it's a bit small here the is node pered data is a bit of a mess some of it is strings and some of it is Boolean and some of it is integer and sometimes it doesn't exist uh so you can see for for example that yam has is node presenter with the Boolean true while I have it with the string true in this data\",\n",
