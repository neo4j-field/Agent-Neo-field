The node variable and the index used are shown in the arguments of the operator. If the index is not unique, the operator is instead called NodeIndexSeek. If the index seek is used to solve a MERGE clause, it will also be marked with (Locking). This makes it clear that any nodes returned from the index will be locked in order to prevent concurrent conflicting updates.|The last part of a MERGE clause is the ON CREATE and/or ON MATCH operators. These allow a query to express additional changes to the properties of a node or relationship, depending on whether the element was matched (MATCH) in the database or if it was created (CREATE).

The following would, therefore, be a more appropriate composition of the query: Query Using map parameters with MERGE MERGE does not support map parameters the same way that CREATE does. To use map parameters with MERGE, it is necessary to explicitly use the expected properties, such as in the following example. For more information on parameters, see Parameters.|Create a relationship  It might feel tempting to create new relationships with a single MERGE clause, such as: MERGE (:Person {name: \"Alice\"})-[:KNOWS]→(:Person {name: \"Bob\"}). However, this would result in the creation of an extra Alice node, so that you would end up with unintended duplicate records. To avoid this, always MATCH the elements that you want to update, and use the resulting reference in the MERGE clause (as shown in the previous example).
