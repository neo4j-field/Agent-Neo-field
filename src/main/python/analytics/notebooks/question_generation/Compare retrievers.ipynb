      "2. **Aggregate Relationships**: Virtual nodes can be used to aggregate relationships between groups of nodes, providing a summary view of the connections within the graph.\n",

      "4. **Enhanced Security**: Virtual nodes can be used to hide away sensitive properties or intermediate nodes/relationships for security reasons, ensuring that only relevant information is accessible to users.\n",

The intention is to illustrate what the results look like and to provide a guide in how to make use of the algorithm in a real setting.

The example graph looks like this: The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:', '3.7. Using intermediate communities As described before, Leiden is a hierarchical clustering algorithm. That means that after every clustering step all nodes that belong to the same cluster are reduced to a single node. Relationships between nodes of the same cluster become self-relationships, relationships to nodes of other clusters connect to the clusters representative. This condensed graph is then used to run the next level of clustering. The process is repeated until the clusters are stable.', 'The Leiden algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm, that recursively merges communities into single nodes by greedily optimizing the modularity and the process repeats in the condensed graph. It modifies the Louvain algorithm to address some of its shortcomings, namely the case where some of the communities found by Louvain are not well-connected. This is achieved by periodically randomly breaking down communities into smaller well-connected ones. For more information on this algorithm, see:', 'To analyze whether this regional clustering exists in our supply chain network, and if so, identify and label the stages within them, we can use the Louvain algorithm. Technically speaking, the Louvain algorithm runs recursively to optimize a modularity score – essentially seeking to assign nodes to communities such that they are as densely connected within the community as possible relative to other random nodes in the graph.', 'Using Louvain Community Detection Louvain is useful for exploratory analysis of communities because it uses a form of modularity scoring to split up the graph into hierarchical clusters. This means that your theories around fraud patterns and graph structure don’t need to be exact for it to provide informative communities and insights.']\n",
